## üé´ Coupon Types & Use Cases

### 1. Cart-Wise Coupons

**Purpose**: Apply discounts to the entire cart based on total value.

**Implemented Cases**:
- ‚úÖ Percentage discount on cart total above threshold
- ‚úÖ Maximum discount cap
- ‚úÖ Minimum cart value requirement
- ‚úÖ Proportional discount distribution across items

**Example**: 10% off on carts over $100
```json
{
  "type": "cart-wise",
  "details": {
    "threshold": 100,
    "discount": 10
  },
  "max_discount": 50
}
```

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- Cart total below threshold (no discount applied)
- Maximum discount cap enforcement
- Zero or negative cart values
- Multiple items with proportional discount distribution

### 2. Product-Wise Coupons

**Purpose**: Apply discounts to specific products in the cart.

**Implemented Cases**:
- ‚úÖ Percentage discount on specific products
- ‚úÖ Multiple quantity support
- ‚úÖ Maximum discount cap per product

**Example**: 20% off on Product A
```json
{
  "type": "product-wise",
  "details": {
    "product_id": 1,
    "discount": 20
  }
}
```

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- Product not in cart (no discount applied)
- Multiple quantities of same product
- Zero or negative product prices
- Product with zero quantity

### 3. Buy X Get Y (BxGy) Coupons

**Purpose**: Buy specified quantities of certain products, get others for free.

**Implemented Cases**:
- ‚úÖ Buy X products from one set, get Y products from another set
- ‚úÖ Repetition limits
- ‚úÖ Multiple product combinations
- ‚úÖ Complex quantity calculations

**Example**: Buy 2 products from [X, Y, Z], get 1 product from [A, B, C] free
```json
{
  "type": "bxgy",
  "details": {
    "buy_products": [
      {"product_id": 1, "quantity": 3},
      {"product_id": 2, "quantity": 3}
    ],
    "get_products": [
      {"product_id": 3, "quantity": 1}
    ],
    "repetition_limit": 2
  }
}
```

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- Insufficient buy products (no discount)
- Insufficient get products (limited by available quantity)
- Repetition limit enforcement
- Complex product combinations
- Partial fulfillment scenarios

## üìä Additional Use Cases Considered

3. **Cart Value Constraints**
   - ‚úÖ Minimum cart value requirements
   - ‚úÖ Maximum discount caps

4. **Coupon Status Management**
   - ‚úÖ Active/inactive coupon status
   - ‚úÖ Bulk status updates

### Complex Scenarios Handled

1. **Multiple Coupon Types in Same Cart**
   - System can identify all applicable coupons
   - Each coupon type calculated independently

2. **BxGy with Complex Constraints**
   - Multiple buy products with different quantities
   - Multiple get products with different quantities
   - Repetition limits with partial fulfillment

3. **Edge Case Calculations**
   - Zero quantities
   - Negative prices (rejected)
   - Fractional discounts (rounded appropriately)
   - Maximum discount enforcement

## üß™ Examples

## üèó Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CouponCalculatorService**: Handles complex discount calculations
2. **CouponsService**: Manages CRUD operations and business logic
3. **CouponsController**: Exposes REST endpoints
4. **TypeORM Entities**: Database models and relationships

### Design Patterns

- **Strategy Pattern**: Different calculation strategies for each coupon type
- **Factory Pattern**: Easy addition of new coupon types
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access layer
- **DTO Pattern**: Input/output validation and transformation

### Extensibility

The system is designed for easy extension:
- New coupon types can be added by implementing calculation strategies
- Additional constraints can be added to existing types
- Database schema supports flexible coupon details storage

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Assumptions & Limitations

### Current Assumptions

1. **Product Management**: Products are managed externally; only product IDs are used
2. **User Management**: No user authentication/authorization implemented
3. **Cart Persistence**: Carts are not persisted; only calculations are performed
4. **Currency**: All amounts are in the same currency (no multi-currency support)
5. **Concurrent Usage**: No handling of concurrent coupon usage
6. **Inventory**: No inventory validation during coupon application

### Implementation Limitations

1. **Single Coupon Application**: Only one coupon can be applied at a time
2. **No Coupon Stacking**: Multiple coupons cannot be combined
3. **No User-Specific Coupons**: All coupons are global (no per-user limits)
4. **No Geographic Restrictions**: No location-based coupon restrictions
5. **No Time-Based Restrictions**: No specific time windows (only expiration dates)
6. **No Category-Based Coupons**: No support for product category discounts

### Technical Limitations

1. **Database**: MySQL-specific features used
2. **Performance**: No caching layer for frequently accessed coupons
3. **Scalability**: No distributed system considerations
4. **Monitoring**: No comprehensive logging or monitoring

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### High Priority
1. **Coupon Stacking**: Allow multiple coupons to be applied simultaneously
2. **User-Specific Coupons**: Per-user usage limits and restrictions
3. **Category-Based Coupons**: Discounts on product categories
4. **Time-Based Restrictions**: Specific time windows for coupon validity
5. **Geographic Restrictions**: Location-based coupon availability

### Medium Priority
1. **Caching Layer**: Redis integration for performance
2. **Analytics**: Coupon usage analytics and reporting
3. **Bulk Operations**: Bulk coupon creation and management
4. **Advanced BxGy**: More complex buy-get combinations
5. **Coupon Templates**: Reusable coupon templates

### Low Priority
1. **Multi-Currency Support**: Different currencies for different regions
2. **Inventory Integration**: Real-time inventory validation
3. **Machine Learning**: Smart coupon recommendations
4. **A/B Testing**: Coupon effectiveness testing
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Predictive analytics for coupon performance
